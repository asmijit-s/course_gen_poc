  "overview": "The course should introduce artificial intelligence concepts in a fun, age-appropriate, and engaging way for students aged 14–18. It must explain basic ideas like algorithms, data, machine learning, and ethical AI using analogies, visuals, and real-life examples (e.g., recommendation systems, chatbots, or smart assistants).\nInclude hands-on activities (like using Teachable Machine, simple Scratch/Blockly projects, or interactive web demos), short video summaries, and quizzes after each module.\nNo prior coding experience is expected. The course should build confidence, curiosity, and responsible thinking about how AI impacts our world.\n",
